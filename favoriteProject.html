                            My Favorite Project from this class was probably Lab 4 with the
                            accessible CSS layouts. This was my favorite project from this class
                            because it taught me how to use different CSS layouts when creating a
                            web page, especially one that was aimed towards accessibility.
                            Previously, I have only ever worked with flex boxes, and they were
                            always a little tedious to work with, and I've seen gridbox around but
                            never experimented with them/knew how to use them. This lab really
                            showed how easy gridbox was to use as well as how to use it to focus on
                            accessibility and universal design which is why it is my favorite lab
                            from this class.
