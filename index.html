                        <p>
                            Hello, my name is Adam Bui and I am a senior studying computer science
                            at the engineering school. This is my 9th semester at CU Boulder with me
                            taking an extra semester before I graduate. I will be graduating in Fall
                            of 2023 with a focus on Software/Web development. I recently interned at
                            Workday, developing my software development skills as well as learning a
                            little bit about making software accessible during my time as an intern.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            On my free time, I enjoy playing video games and producing music/DJing.
                            I have been making music for about 9 years and primarily make electronic
                            music. I also enjoy going to electronic music concerts and typically go
                            multiple times a year. When it comes to video games, I typically play
                            competitive games and was on the CU Boulder Valorant team during fall of
                            2020. I have began to transition towards more casual games, but still
                            play competitive games at a high level from time to time.
