                                J. Robert Oppenheimer (born Julius Robert Oppenheimer; /ˈɒpənhaɪmər/
                                OP-ən-hy-mər; April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American
                                theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project's Los
                                Alamos Laboratory during World War II. He is often called the
                                "father of the atomic bomb". Born in New York City, Oppenheimer
                                earned a bachelor of arts degree in chemistry from Harvard
                                University in 1925 and a doctorate in physics from the University of
                                Göttingen in Germany in 1927, where he studied under Max Born. After
                                research at other institutions, he joined the physics department at
                                the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a full
                                professor in 1936. He made significant contributions to theoretical
                                physics, including achievements in quantum mechanics and nuclear
                                physics such as the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for molecular
                                wave functions, work on the theory of electrons and positrons, the
                                Oppenheimer–Phillips process in nuclear fusion, and early work on
                                quantum tunneling. With his students, he also made contributions to
                                the theory of neutron stars and black holes, quantum field theory,
                                and the interactions of cosmic rays. In 1942, Oppenheimer was
                                recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, and in 1943 he was
                                appointed director of the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New
                                Mexico, tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons. His
                                leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the
                                project's success. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the first
                                test of the atomic bomb, Trinity. In August 1945, the weapons were
                                used against Japan in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the
                                only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict. In 1947,
                                Oppenheimer became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study
                                in Princeton, New Jersey, and chaired the influential General
                                Advisory Committee of the newly created U.S. Atomic Energy
                                Commission. He lobbied for international control of nuclear power to
                                avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet
                                Union. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb during a
                                1949–1950 governmental debate on the question and subsequently took
                                positions on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some
                                U.S. government and military factions. During the second Red Scare,
                                Oppenheimer's stances, together with his past associations with the
                                Communist Party USA, led to the revocation of his security clearance
                                following a 1954 security hearing. This effectively ended his access
                                to the government's atomic secrets and thus his career as a nuclear
                                physicist. Stripped also of his direct political influence,
                                Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write, and work in physics. In
                                1963, he was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of
                                political rehabilitation. He died four years later of throat cancer.
                                In 2022, the federal government vacated the 1954 revocation of
                                Oppenheimer's security clearance.

                                        Childhood and education Oppenheimer was born Julius Robert
                                        Oppenheimer [note 1] into a non-observant Jewish family in
                                        New York City on April 22, 1904, to Ella (née Friedman), a
                                        painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a successful
                                        textile importer.[5][6] Robert had a younger brother, Frank,
                                        who also became a physicist.[7] Their father was born in
                                        Hanau, then part of the Hesse-Nassau province of the Kingdom
                                        of Prussia, and came to the United States as a teenager in
                                        1888 with few resources and no money, higher education, or
                                        knowledge of the English language. He was hired by a textile
                                        company and within a decade was an executive there,
                                        eventually becoming wealthy.[8] In 1912, the family moved to
                                        an apartment on Riverside Drive near West 88th Street,
                                        Manhattan, an area known for luxurious mansions and
                                        townhouses.[6] Their art collection included works by Pablo
                                        Picasso, Édouard Vuillard, and Vincent van Gogh.[9]
                                        Oppenheimer was initially educated at Alcuin Preparatory
                                        School. In 1911, he entered the Ethical Culture Society
                                        School,[10] founded by Felix Adler to promote training based
                                        on the Ethical Culture movement, whose motto was "Deed
                                        before Creed". Oppenheimer's father had been a member of the
                                        Society for many years, serving on its board of
                                        trustees.[11] Oppenheimer was a versatile student,
                                        interested in English and French literature, and
                                        particularly mineralogy.[12] He completed third and fourth
                                        grades in one year and skipped half of eighth grade.[10]
                                        During his final year, Oppenheimer became interested in
                                        chemistry.[13] He graduated in 1921, but his further
                                        education was delayed a year by an attack of colitis
                                        contracted while prospecting in Joachimstal during a family
                                        vacation in Czechoslovakia. He recovered in New Mexico,
                                        where he developed a love for horseback riding and the
                                        southwestern United States.[14] Oppenheimer entered Harvard
                                        College in 1922 at age 18. He majored in chemistry; Harvard
                                        also required studies in history, literature, and philosophy
                                        or mathematics. To compensate for the delay caused by his
                                        illness, he took six courses each term instead of the usual
                                        four. He was admitted to the undergraduate honor society Phi
                                        Beta Kappa and was granted graduate standing in physics on
                                        the basis of independent study, which meant he could bypass
                                        basic courses in favor of advanced ones. He was attracted to
                                        experimental physics by a course on thermodynamics taught by
                                        Percy Bridgman. Oppenheimer graduated from Harvard in 1925
                                        with a Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude, after only three
                                        years of study.[15]

                                        After being accepted at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1924,
                                        Oppenheimer wrote to Ernest Rutherford requesting permission
                                        to work at the Cavendish Laboratory, though Bridgman's
                                        letter of recommendation said that Oppenheimer's clumsiness
                                        in the laboratory suggested that theoretical, rather than
                                        experimental, physics would be his forte. Rutherford was
                                        unimpressed, but Oppenheimer went to Cambridge
                                        nonetheless;[16] J. J. Thomson ultimately accepted him on
                                        the condition that he complete a basic laboratory
                                        course.[17] Oppenheimer was very unhappy at Cambridge and
                                        wrote to a friend: "I am having a pretty bad time. The lab
                                        work is a terrible bore, and I am so bad at it that it is
                                        impossible to feel that I am learning anything".[18] He
                                        developed an antagonistic relationship with his tutor,
                                        Patrick Blackett, a future Nobel laureate. According to
                                        Oppenheimer's friend Francis Fergusson, Oppenheimer once
                                        confessed to leaving an apple injected with poison on
                                        Blackett's desk; no one ate it. Oppenheimer's parents
                                        convinced the university authorities not to press criminal
                                        charges or expel him. Instead Oppenheimer was placed on
                                        probation and had to have regular sessions with a
                                        psychiatrist in Harley Street, London.[19][20][21]
                                        Oppenheimer was a tall, thin chain smoker,[22] who often
                                        neglected to eat during periods of intense concentration.
                                        Many friends said he could be self-destructive. Fergusson
                                        once tried to distract Oppenheimer from his apparent
                                        depression by telling him that he (Fergusson) was to marry
                                        his girlfriend; Oppenheimer jumped on Fergusson and tried to
                                        strangle him. Oppenheimer was plagued by periods of
                                        depression throughout his life,[23][24] and once told his
                                        brother, "I need physics more than friends".[25] In 1926,
                                        Oppenheimer left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen
                                        to study under Max Born; Göttingen was one of the world's
                                        leading centers for theoretical physics. Oppenheimer made
                                        friends who went on to great success, including Werner
                                        Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac,
                                        Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller. He was enthusiastic in
                                        discussion to the point of sometimes taking them over.[26]
                                        Maria Goeppert presented Born with a petition signed by
                                        herself and others threatening a boycott of the class unless
                                        he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it out on his desk
                                        where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective
                                        without a word being said.[27] Oppenheimer obtained his
                                        Doctor of Philosophy degree in March 1927 at age 23,
                                        supervised by Max Born.[28][29] After the oral exam, James
                                        Franck, the professor administering, reportedly said, "I'm
                                        glad that's over. He was on the point of questioning
                                        me."[30] Oppenheimer published more than a dozen papers
                                        while in Europe, including many important contributions to
                                        the new field of quantum mechanics. He and Born published a
                                        famous paper on the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, which
                                        separates nuclear motion from electronic motion in the
                                        mathematical treatment of molecules, allowing nuclear motion
                                        to be neglected to simplify calculations. It remains his
                                        most cited work.[31]

                                        Oppenheimer was awarded a United States National Research
                                        Council fellowship to the California Institute of Technology
                                        (Caltech) in September 1927. Bridgman also wanted him at
                                        Harvard, so a compromise was reached whereby he split his
                                        fellowship for the 1927–28 academic year between Harvard in
                                        1927 and Caltech in 1928.[32] At Caltech, he struck up a
                                        close friendship with Linus Pauling; they planned to mount a
                                        joint attack on the nature of the chemical bond, a field in
                                        which Pauling was a pioneer, with Oppenheimer supplying the
                                        mathematics and Pauling interpreting the results. The
                                        collaboration, and their friendship, ended after Oppenheimer
                                        invited Pauling's wife, Ava Helen Pauling, to join him on a
                                        tryst in Mexico.[33] Oppenheimer later invited Pauling to be
                                        head of the Chemistry Division of the Manhattan Project, but
                                        Pauling refused, saying he was a pacifist.[34] In the autumn
                                        of 1928, Oppenheimer visited Paul Ehrenfest's institute at
                                        the University of Leiden, the Netherlands, where he
                                        impressed by giving lectures in Dutch, despite having little
                                        experience with the language. There, he was given the
                                        nickname of Opje,[35] later anglicized by his students as
                                        "Oppie".[36] From Leiden, he continued on to the Swiss
                                        Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich to work with
                                        Wolfgang Pauli on quantum mechanics and the continuous
                                        spectrum. Oppenheimer respected and liked Pauli and may have
                                        emulated his personal style as well as his critical approach
                                        to problems.[37] On returning to the United States,
                                        Oppenheimer accepted an associate professorship from the
                                        University of California, Berkeley, where Raymond T. Birge
                                        wanted him so badly that he expressed a willingness to share
                                        him with Caltech.[34] Before he began his Berkeley
                                        professorship, Oppenheimer was diagnosed with a mild case of
                                        tuberculosis and spent some weeks with his brother Frank at
                                        a New Mexico ranch, which he leased and eventually
                                        purchased. When he heard the ranch was available for lease,
                                        he exclaimed, "Hot dog!", and he later called it Perro
                                        Caliente ("hot dog" in Spanish).[38] Later, he used to say
                                        that "physics and desert country" were his "two great
                                        loves".[39] He recovered from tuberculosis and returned to
                                        Berkeley, where he prospered as an advisor and collaborator
                                        to a generation of physicists who admired him for his
                                        intellectual virtuosity and broad interests. His students
                                        and colleagues saw him as mesmerizing: hypnotic in private
                                        interaction, but often frigid in more public settings. His
                                        associates fell into two camps: one saw him as an aloof and
                                        impressive genius and aesthete, the other as a pretentious
                                        and insecure poseur.[40] His students almost always fell
                                        into the former category, adopting his walk, speech, and
                                        other mannerisms, and even his inclination for reading
                                        entire texts in their original languages.[41] Hans Bethe
                                        said of him:
                                    </p>

                                        Probably the most important ingredient he brought to his
                                        teaching was his exquisite taste. He always knew what were
                                        the important problems, as shown by his choice of subjects.
                                        He truly lived with those problems, struggling for a
                                        solution, and he communicated his concern to the group. In
                                        its heyday, there were about eight or ten graduate students
                                        in his group and about six Post-doctoral Fellows. He met
                                        this group once a day in his office and discussed with one
                                        after another the status of the student's research problem.
                                        He was interested in everything, and in one afternoon they
                                        might discuss quantum electrodynamics, cosmic rays, electron
                                        pair production and nuclear physics.[42]

                                        Oppenheimer worked closely with Nobel Prize-winning
                                        experimental physicist Ernest O. Lawrence and his cyclotron
                                        pioneers, helping them understand the data that their
                                        machines were producing at Berkeley's Radiation Laboratory,
                                        which eventually developed into today's Lawrence Berkeley
                                        National Laboratory.[43] In 1936, Berkeley promoted him to
                                        full professor at an annual salary of $3,300 (equivalent to
                                        $70,000 in 2022). In return, he was asked to curtail his
                                        teaching at Caltech, so a compromise was reached whereby
                                        Berkeley released him for six weeks each year, enough to
                                        teach one term at Caltech.[44]

                                        Oppenheimer did important research in theoretical astronomy
                                        (especially as related to general relativity and nuclear
                                        theory), nuclear physics, spectroscopy, and quantum field
                                        theory, including its extension into quantum
                                        electrodynamics. The formal mathematics of relativistic
                                        quantum mechanics also attracted his attention, although he
                                        doubted its validity. His work predicted many later finds,
                                        including the neutron, meson and neutron star.[45]
                                        Initially, his major interest was the theory of the
                                        continuous spectrum. His first published paper, in 1926,
                                        concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He
                                        developed a method to carry out calculations of its
                                        transition probabilities. He calculated the photoelectric
                                        effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption
                                        coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with
                                        observations of the X-ray absorption of the Sun, but not
                                        helium. Years later, it was realized that the Sun was
                                        largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were
                                        correct.[46][47] Oppenheimer made important contributions to
                                        the theory of cosmic ray showers. He also worked on the
                                        problem of field electron emission.[48][49] This work
                                        contributed to the development of the concept of quantum
                                        tunneling.[50] In 1931, he co-wrote a paper, "Relativistic
                                        Theory of the Photoelectric Effect", with his student Harvey
                                        Hall,[51] in which, based on empirical evidence, he
                                        correctly disputed Dirac's assertion that two of the energy
                                        levels of the hydrogen atom have the same energy.
                                        Subsequently, one of his doctoral students, Willis Lamb,
                                        determined that this was a consequence of what became known
                                        as the Lamb shift, for which Lamb was awarded the Nobel
                                        Prize in physics in 1955.[45] With Melba Phillips, the first
                                        graduate student to begin her PhD under Oppenheimer's
                                        supervision,[note 2] Oppenheimer worked on calculations of
                                        artificial radioactivity under bombardment by deuterons.
                                        When Ernest Lawrence and Edwin McMillan bombarded nuclei
                                        with deuterons they found the results agreed closely with
                                        the predictions of George Gamow, but when higher energies
                                        and heavier nuclei were involved, the results did not
                                        conform to the theory. In 1935, Oppenheimer and Phillips
                                        worked out a theory—subsequently known as the
                                        Oppenheimer–Phillips process—to explain the results. This
                                        theory is still in use today.[53][note 3] As early as 1930,
                                        Oppenheimer wrote a paper that essentially predicted the
                                        existence of the positron. This was after a paper by Dirac
                                        proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge
                                        and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation,
                                        later known as the Dirac equation, that unified quantum
                                        mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of
                                        electron spin, to explain the Zeeman effect.[55] Drawing on
                                        the body of experimental evidence, Oppenheimer rejected the
                                        idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were
                                        protons. He argued that they would have to have the same
                                        mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons
                                        were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl
                                        David Anderson discovered the positron, for which he
                                        received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.[56] In the late
                                        1930s, Oppenheimer became interested in astrophysics, most
                                        likely through his friendship with Richard Tolman, resulting
                                        in a series of papers. In the first of these, "On the
                                        Stability of Stellar Neutron Cores" (1938),[57] co-written
                                        with Robert Serber, Oppenheimer explored the properties of
                                        white dwarfs. This was followed by a paper co-written with
                                        one of his students, George Volkoff, "On Massive Neutron
                                        Cores",[58] which demonstrated that there was a limit, known
                                        as the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, to the mass of
                                        stars beyond which they would not remain stable as neutron
                                        stars and would undergo gravitational collapse. In 1939,
                                        Oppenheimer and another of his students, Hartland Snyder,
                                        produced the paper "On Continued Gravitational
                                        Contraction",[59] which predicted the existence of what
                                        later became termed black holes. After the Born–Oppenheimer
                                        approximation paper, these papers remain his most cited, and
                                        were key factors in the rejuvenation of astrophysical
                                        research in the United States in the 1950s, mainly by John
                                        A. Wheeler.[60] Oppenheimer's papers were considered
                                        difficult to understand even by the standards of the
                                        abstract topics he was expert in. He was fond of using
                                        elegant, if extremely complex, mathematical techniques to
                                        demonstrate physical principles, though he was sometimes
                                        criticized for making mathematical mistakes, presumably out
                                        of haste. "His physics was good", said his student Snyder,
                                        "but his arithmetic awful".[45] After World War II,
                                        Oppenheimer published only five scientific papers, one of
                                        them in biophysics, and none after 1950. Murray Gell-Mann, a
                                        later Nobelist who, as a visiting scientist, worked with him
                                        at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1951, offered this
                                        opinion:
                                    </p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        He didn't have Sitzfleisch, "sitting flesh," when you sit on
                                        a chair. As far as I know, he never wrote a long paper or
                                        did a long calculation, anything of that kind. He didn't
                                        have patience for that; his own work consisted of little
                                        aperçus, but quite brilliant ones. But he inspired other
                                        people to do things, and his influence was fantastic.[61]

                                        During the 1920s, Oppenheimer remained uninformed on worldly
                                        matters. He claimed that he did not read newspapers or
                                        popular magazines and only learned of the Wall Street crash
                                        of 1929 while he was on a walk with Ernest Lawrence six
                                        months after the crash occurred.[62][63] He once remarked
                                        that he never cast a vote until the 1936 presidential
                                        election. From 1934 on, he became increasingly concerned
                                        about politics and international affairs. In 1934, he
                                        earmarked three percent of his annual salary—about $100
                                        (equivalent to $2,200 in 2022)—for two years to support
                                        German physicists fleeing Nazi Germany. During the 1934 West
                                        Coast Waterfront Strike, he and some of his students,
                                        including Melba Phillips and Bob Serber, attended a
                                        longshoremen's rally. Oppenheimer repeatedly attempted to
                                        get Serber a position at Berkeley but was blocked by
                                        Berkeley Physics Department administrator Raymond T. Birge,
                                        who felt that "one Jew in the department was enough".[64]
                                        Oppenheimer's mother died in 1931, and he became closer to
                                        his father who, although still living in New York, became a
                                        frequent visitor in California.[65] When his father died in
                                        1937, leaving $392,602 (equivalent to $8 million in 2022) to
                                        be divided between Oppenheimer and his brother Frank,
                                        Oppenheimer immediately wrote out a will that left his
                                        estate to the University of California to be used for
                                        graduate scholarships.[66] Like many young intellectuals in
                                        the 1930s, Oppenheimer supported social reforms that were
                                        later categorized as communist ideas. He donated to many
                                        progressive causes considered left-wing during the McCarthy
                                        era. Most of his allegedly radical work consisted of hosting
                                        fundraisers for the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil
                                        War and other anti-fascist activity. He never openly joined
                                        the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), though he did give money to
                                        leftist causes by way of acquaintances who were alleged to
                                        be members.[67] When he joined the Manhattan Project in
                                        1942, Oppenheimer wrote on his personal security
                                        questionnaire that he had been "a member of just about every
                                        Communist Front organization on the West Coast".[68] Years
                                        later, he claimed that he did not remember saying this, that
                                        it was not true, and that if he had said anything along
                                        those lines, it was "a half-jocular overstatement".[69] He
                                        was a subscriber to the People's World,[70] a Communist
                                        Party organ, and he testified in 1954, "I was associated
                                        with the communist movement".[71] From 1937 to 1942,
                                        Oppenheimer was a member at Berkeley of what he called a
                                        "discussion group", which was later identified by fellow
                                        members Haakon Chevalier[72][73] and Gordon Griffiths as a
                                        "closed" (secret) unit of the Communist Party for Berkeley
                                        faculty.[74] The FBI opened a file on Oppenheimer in March
                                        1941. It recorded that he attended a meeting in December
                                        1940 at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the
                                        Communist Party's California state secretary, William
                                        Schneiderman, and its treasurer, Isaac Folkoff. The FBI
                                        noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the
                                        American Civil Liberties Union, which it considered a
                                        communist front organization. Shortly thereafter, the FBI
                                        added Oppenheimer to its Custodial Detention Index, for
                                        arrest in case of national emergency.[75] Many of
                                        Oppenheimer's closest associates were active in the
                                        Communist Party in the 1930s or 1940s, including his brother
                                        Frank, Frank's wife Jackie,[76] Kitty,[77] Tatlock, his
                                        landlady Mary Ellen Washburn,[78] and several of his
                                        graduate students at Berkeley.[79] Whether Oppenheimer was a
                                        party member has been debated. Almost all historians agree
                                        he had strong left-wing views during this time and
                                        interacted with party members, but it is disputed whether he
                                        was an official member. At his 1954 security clearance
                                        hearings, he denied being a member of the Communist Party
                                        but identified himself as a fellow traveler, which he
                                        defined as someone who agrees with many of communism's goals
                                        but is not willing to blindly follow orders from any
                                        Communist Party apparatus.[80]

                                        In 1936, Oppenheimer became involved with Jean Tatlock, the
                                        daughter of a Berkeley literature professor and a student at
                                        Stanford University School of Medicine. The two had similar
                                        political views; she wrote for the Western Worker, a
                                        Communist Party newspaper.[81] In 1939, after a tempestuous
                                        relationship, Tatlock broke up with Oppenheimer. In August
                                        of that year, he met Katherine ("Kitty") Puening, a radical
                                        Berkeley student and former Communist Party member. Kitty's
                                        first marriage had lasted only a few months. Her second,
                                        common-law husband was Joe Dallet, an active member of the
                                        Communist Party killed in the Spanish Civil War.[82] Kitty
                                        returned from Europe to the U.S., where she obtained a
                                        Bachelor of Arts degree in botany from the University of
                                        Pennsylvania. In 1938 she married Richard Harrison, a
                                        physician and medical researcher, and in June 1939 moved
                                        with him to Pasadena, California, where he became chief of
                                        radiology at a local hospital and she enrolled as a graduate
                                        student at the University of California, Los Angeles. She
                                        and Oppenheimer created a minor scandal by sleeping together
                                        after one of Tolman's parties, and in the summer of 1940 she
                                        stayed with Oppenheimer at his ranch in New Mexico. When it
                                        was discovered she was pregnant, Kitty asked Harrison for a
                                        divorce, to which he acceded. On November 1, 1940, she
                                        obtained a quick divorce in Reno, Nevada, and married
                                        Oppenheimer.[83][84] Their first child, Peter, was born in
                                        May 1941, and their second, Katherine ("Toni"), was born in
                                        Los Alamos, New Mexico, on December 7, 1944.[85] During his
                                        marriage, Oppenheimer rekindled his affair with Tatlock.[86]
                                        Later, their continued contact became an issue in his
                                        security clearance hearings because of Tatlock's communist
                                        associations.[87] Throughout the development of the atomic
                                        bomb, Oppenheimer was under investigation by both the FBI
                                        and the Manhattan Project's internal security arm for his
                                        past left-wing associations. He was followed by Army
                                        security agents during a trip to California in June 1943 to
                                        visit Tatlock, who was suffering from depression.
                                        Oppenheimer spent the night in her apartment.[88] Tatlock
                                        killed herself on January 4, 1944, leaving Oppenheimer
                                        deeply grieved.[89] At Los Alamos, Oppenheimer began an
                                        emotional affair with Ruth Tolman, a psychologist and the
                                        wife of his friend Richard Tolman. The affair ended after
                                        Oppenheimer returned east to become director of the
                                        Institute for Advanced Study but, after Richard's death in
                                        August 1948, they reconnected and saw each other
                                        occasionally until Ruth's death in 1957. Few of their
                                        letters survive, but those that do reflect a close and
                                        affectionate relationship, with Oppenheimer calling her "My
                                        Love".[90][91]

                                        Oppenheimer's diverse interests sometimes interrupted his
                                        focus on science. He liked things that were difficult and
                                        since much of the scientific work appeared easy for him, he
                                        developed an interest in the mystical and the cryptic.[93]
                                        After leaving Harvard, he began to acquaint himself with the
                                        classical Hindu texts through their English
                                        translations.[94] He also had an interest in learning
                                        languages and learned Sanskrit,[note 4] under Arthur W.
                                        Ryder at Berkeley in 1933.[96][97] He eventually read
                                        literary works such as the Bhagavad Gita and Meghaduta in
                                        the original Sanskrit, and deeply pondered them. He later
                                        cited the Gita as one of the books that most shaped his
                                        philosophy of life.[98][99] He wrote to his brother that the
                                        Gita was "very easy and quite marvelous", and called it "the
                                        most beautiful philosophical song existing in any known
                                        tongue".[97] He later gave copies of it as presents to his
                                        friends and kept a personal, worn-out copy on the bookshelf
                                        by his desk.[97] He nicknamed his car Garuda, the mount bird
                                        of the Hindu god Vishnu.[100] Oppenheimer never became a
                                        Hindu in the traditional sense; he did not join any temple
                                        nor pray to any god.[101][102] He "was really taken by the
                                        charm and the general wisdom of the Bhagavad-Gita", his
                                        brother said.[101] It is speculated that Oppenheimer's
                                        interest in Hindu thought started during his earlier
                                        association with Niels Bohr.[103] Both Bohr and Oppenheimer
                                        had been very analytical and critical about the ancient
                                        Hindu mythological stories and the metaphysics embedded in
                                        them.[103] In one conversation with David Hawkins before the
                                        war, while talking about the literature of ancient Greece,
                                        Oppenheimer remarked, "I have read the Greeks; I find the
                                        Hindus deeper."[103] His close confidant and colleague
                                        Isidor Rabi, who had seen Oppenheimer throughout his
                                        Berkeley, Los Alamos, and Princeton years, wondering "why
                                        men of Oppenheimer's gifts do not discover everything worth
                                        discovering",[104] reflected that:

                                    <blockquote>
                                        Oppenheimer was overeducated in those fields which lie
                                        outside the scientific tradition, such as his interest in
                                        religion, in the Hindu religion in particular, which
                                        resulted in a feeling for the mystery of the universe that
                                        surrounded him almost like a fog. He saw physics clearly,
                                        looking toward what had already been done, but at the border
                                        he tended to feel there was much more of the mysterious and
                                        novel than there actually was ... [he turned] away from the
                                        hard, crude methods of theoretical physics into a mystical
                                        realm of broad intuition.... In Oppenheimer the element of
                                        earthiness was feeble. Yet it was essentially this spiritual
                                        quality, this refinement as expressed in speech and manner,
                                        that was the basis of his charisma. He never expressed

                                        depths of sensibility and insight not yet revealed. These
                                        may be the qualities of the born leader who seems to have

                                        In spite of this, observers such as physicist Luis Alvarez
                                        have suggested that if Oppenheimer had lived long enough to
                                        see his predictions substantiated by experiment, he might
                                        have won a Nobel Prize for his work on gravitational
                                        collapse, concerning neutron stars and black
                                        holes.[106][107] In retrospect, some physicists and
                                        historians consider this his most important contribution,
                                        though it was not taken up by other scientists in his
                                        lifetime.[108] The physicist and historian Abraham Pais once
                                        asked Oppenheimer what he considered his most important
                                        scientific contributions; Oppenheimer cited his work on
                                        electrons and positrons, not his work on gravitational
                                        contraction.[109] Oppenheimer was nominated for the Nobel
                                        Prize for physics three times, in 1946, 1951 and 1967, but
                                        never won.[110][111]

                                        On October 9, 1941, two months before the United States
                                        entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt
                                        approved a crash program to develop an atomic bomb. Lawrence
                                        brought Oppenheimer into the project on October 21. On May
                                        18, 1942, [112] National Defense Research Committee Chairman
                                        James B. Conant, who had been one of Oppenheimer's lecturers
                                        at Harvard, asked Oppenheimer to take over work on fast
                                        neutron calculations, a task Oppenheimer threw himself into
                                        with full vigor. He was given the title "Coordinator of
                                        Rapid Rupture", which specifically referred to the
                                        propagation of a fast neutron chain reaction in an atomic
                                        bomb. One of his first acts was to host a summer school for
                                        bomb theory in Berkeley. The mix of European physicists and
                                        his own students—a group including Robert Serber, Emil
                                        Konopinski, Felix Bloch, Hans Bethe and Edward Teller—kept
                                        themselves busy by calculating what needed to be done, and
                                        in what order, to make the bomb.[113][114] Mug shot with
                                        "K-6" over it. In June 1942, the U.S. Army established the
                                        Manhattan Engineer District to handle its part in the atom
                                        bomb project, beginning the process of transferring
                                        responsibility from the Office of Scientific Research and
                                        Development to the military.[115] In September, Brigadier
                                        General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was appointed director of what
                                        became known as the Manhattan Project.[116] By October 12,
                                        1942, Groves and Oppenheimer had decided that for security
                                        and cohesion, they needed to establish a centralized, secret
                                        research laboratory in a remote location.[117] Groves
                                        selected Oppenheimer to head the project's secret weapons
                                        laboratory, although it is not known precisely when.[118]
                                        This decision surprised many, because Oppenheimer had
                                        left-wing political views and no record as a leader of large
                                        projects. Groves worried that because Oppenheimer did not
                                        have a Nobel Prize, he might not have had the prestige to
                                        direct fellow scientists,[119] but Groves was impressed by
                                        Oppenheimer's singular grasp of the practical aspects of the
                                        project and by the breadth of his knowledge. As a military
                                        engineer, Groves knew that this would be vital in an
                                        interdisciplinary project that would involve not just
                                        physics but also chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance, and
                                        engineering. Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something
                                        that many others did not, an "overweening ambition",[120]
                                        which Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to
                                        push the project to a successful conclusion.[120]
                                        Oppenheimer's past associations were not overlooked, but on
                                        July 20, 1943, Groves directed that he receive a security
                                        clearance "without delay irrespective of the information
                                        which you have concerning Mr Oppenheimer. He is absolutely
                                        essential to the project."[121] Rabi considered
                                        Oppenheimer's appointment "a real stroke of genius on the
                                        part of General Groves, who was not generally considered to
                                        be a genius".[122] Oppenheimer favored a location for the
                                        laboratory in New Mexico, not far from his ranch. On
                                        November 16, 1942, he, Groves and others toured a
                                        prospective site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs
                                        surrounding it would feel claustrophobic, and there was
                                        concern about possible flooding. He then suggested a site he
                                        knew well: a flat mesa near Santa Fe, New Mexico, which was
                                        the site of a private boys' school, the Los Alamos Ranch
                                        School. The engineers were concerned about the poor access
                                        road and the water supply but otherwise felt that it was
                                        ideal.[123] The Los Alamos Laboratory was built on the site
                                        of the school, taking over some of its buildings, while many
                                        new buildings were erected in great haste. At the
                                        laboratory, Oppenheimer assembled a group of the top
                                        physicists of the time, whom he called the
                                        "luminaries".[124] Los Alamos was initially supposed to be a
                                        military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers
                                        were to be commissioned into the Army. He went so far as to
                                        order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the
                                        Army physical test, which he failed. Army doctors considered
                                        him underweight at 128 pounds (58 kg), diagnosed his chronic
                                        cough as tuberculosis, and were concerned about his chronic
                                        lumbosacral joint pain.[125] The plan to commission
                                        scientists fell through when Rabi and Robert Bacher balked
                                        at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a
                                        compromise whereby the University of California operated the
                                        laboratory under contract to the War Department.[126] It
                                        soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely underestimated
                                        the magnitude of the project: Los Alamos grew from a few
                                        hundred people in 1943 to over 6,000 in 1945.[125]
                                        Oppenheimer at first had difficulty with the organizational
                                        division of large groups but rapidly learned the art of
                                        large-scale administration after he took up permanent
                                        residence at Los Alamos. He was noted for his mastery of all
                                        scientific aspects of the project and for his efforts to
                                        control the inevitable cultural conflicts between scientists
                                        and the military. Victor Weisskopf wrote:

                                        Oppenheimer directed these studies, theoretical and
                                        experimental, in the real sense of the words. Here his
                                        uncanny speed in grasping the main points of any subject was
                                        a decisive factor; he could acquaint himself with the
                                        essential details of every part of the work. He did not
                                        direct from the head office. He was intellectually and
                                        physically present at each decisive step. He was present in
                                        the laboratory or in the seminar rooms, when a new effect
                                        was measured, when a new idea was conceived. It was not that
                                        he contributed so many ideas or suggestions; he did so
                                        sometimes, but his main influence came from something else.
                                        It was his continuous and intense presence, which produced a
                                        sense of direct participation in all of us; it created that
                                        unique atmosphere of enthusiasm and challenge that pervaded
                                        the place throughout its time.[127]

                                        might be progressing faster than the Manhattan
                                        Project.[128][129] In a letter dated May 25, 1943,
                                        Oppenheimer responded to a proposal by Fermi to use
                                        radioactive materials to poison German food supplies.
                                        Oppenheimer asked Fermi whether he could produce enough
                                        strontium without letting too many in on the secret.
                                        Oppenheimer continued, "I think we should not attempt a plan
                                        unless we can poison food sufficient to kill a half a
                                        million men".[130] In 1943, development efforts were
                                        directed to a plutonium gun-type fission weapon called "Thin
                                        Man". Initial research on the properties of plutonium was
                                        done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was
                                        extremely pure but could be created only in tiny amounts.
                                        When Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from
                                        the X-10 Graphite Reactor in April 1944, a problem was
                                        discovered: reactor-bred plutonium had a higher
                                        concentration of plutonium-240, making it unsuitable for use
                                        in a gun-type weapon.[131] In July 1944, Oppenheimer
                                        abandoned the gun design in favor of an implosion-type
                                        weapon. Using chemical explosive lenses, a sub-critical
                                        sphere of fissile material could be squeezed into a smaller
                                        and denser form. The metal needed to travel only very short
                                        distances, so the critical mass would be assembled in much
                                        less time.[132] In August 1944, Oppenheimer implemented a
                                        sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to
                                        focus on implosion.[133] He concentrated the development
                                        efforts on the gun-type device, a simpler design that only
                                        had to work with uranium-235, in a single group. This device
                                        became Little Boy in February 1945.[134] After a mammoth
                                        research effort, the more complex design of the implosion
                                        device, known as the "Christy gadget" after Robert Christy,
                                        another student of Oppenheimer's,[135] was finalized in a
                                        meeting in Oppenheimer's office on February 28, 1945.[136]
                                        In May 1945, an Interim Committee was created to advise and
                                        report on wartime and postwar policies regarding the use of
                                        nuclear energy. The Interim Committee established a
                                        scientific panel consisting of Oppenheimer, Arthur Compton,
                                        Fermi, and Lawrence to advise it on scientific issues. In
                                        its presentation to the Interim Committee, the panel offered
                                        its opinion not just on an atomic bomb's likely physical
                                        effects but also on its likely military and political
                                        impact.[137] This included opinions on such sensitive issues
                                        as whether the Soviet Union should be advised of the weapon
                                        in advance of its use against Japan.[138]

                                        In the early morning hours of July 16, 1945, near
                                        Alamogordo, New Mexico, the work at Los Alamos culminated in
                                        the test of the world's first nuclear weapon. Oppenheimer
                                        had code-named the site "Trinity" in mid-1944, saying later
                                        that the name came from John Donne's Holy Sonnets; he had
                                        been introduced to Donne's work in the 1930s by Jean
                                        Tatlock, who killed herself in January 1944.[140][141]
                                        Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, who was present in the
                                        control bunker with Oppenheimer, recalled:
                                    </p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        Dr. Oppenheimer, on whom had rested a very heavy burden,
                                        grew tenser as the last seconds ticked off. He scarcely
                                        breathed. He held on to a post to steady himself. For the
                                        last few seconds, he stared directly ahead and then when the
                                        announcer shouted "Now!" and there came this tremendous
                                        burst of light followed shortly thereafter by the deep
                                        growling roar of the explosion, his face relaxed into an
                                        expression of tremendous relief.[142]

                                        Oppenheimer's brother Frank recalled Oppenheimer's first
                                        words as, "I guess it worked".[143][144] Two men, one in a
                                        suit and hat and the other in military uniform, stand in
                                        front of twisted metal whilst wearing white overshoes
                                        According to a 1949 magazine profile, while witnessing the
                                        explosion Oppenheimer thought of verses from the Bhagavad
                                        Gita: "If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at
                                        once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the
                                        mighty one ... Now I am become Death, the shatterer of
                                        worlds."[146] In 1965 he recalled the moment this way:
                                    </p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        We knew the world would not be the same. A few people
                                        laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I
                                        remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad
                                        Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should
                                        do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed
                                        form and says, "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of
                                        worlds." I suppose we all thought that, one way or
                                        another.[147][note 5]

                                        Rabi described seeing Oppenheimer somewhat later: "I'll
                                        never forget his walk ... like High Noon ... this kind of
                                        strut. He had done it".[154] Despite many scientists'
                                        opposition to using the bomb on Japan, Compton, Fermi, and
                                        Oppenheimer believed that a test explosion would not
                                        convince Japan to surrender.[155] At an August 6 assembly at
                                        Los Alamos, the evening of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima,
                                        Oppenheimer took to the stage and clasped his hands together
                                        "like a prize-winning boxer" while the crowd cheered. He
                                        expressed regret that the weapon was ready too late for use
                                        against Nazi Germany.[156] On August 17, however,
                                        Oppenheimer traveled to Washington to hand-deliver a letter
                                        to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson expressing his
                                        revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned.[157]
                                        In October he met with President Harry S. Truman, who
                                        dismissed Oppenheimer's concern about an arms race with the
                                        Soviet Union and belief that atomic energy should be under
                                        international control. Truman became infuriated when
                                        Oppenheimer said, "Mr. President, I feel I have blood on my
                                        hands", responding that he (Truman) bore sole responsibility
                                        for the decision to use atomic weapons against Japan, and
                                        later said, "I don't want to see that son of a bitch in this
                                        office ever again".[158][159] For his services as director
                                        of Los Alamos, Oppenheimer was awarded the Medal for Merit
                                        by Truman in 1946.[160]

                                Once the public learned of the Manhattan Project after the bombings
                                of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer—suddenly a household name as
                                the "father of the atomic bomb"—became a national spokesman for
                                science, emblematic of a new type of technocratic
                                power;[89][161][162] he appeared on the covers of Life and
                                Time.[163][164] Nuclear physics became a powerful force as nations
                                realized the strategic and political power that atomic weapons
                                conferred. Like many scientists of his generation, Oppenheimer felt
                                that security from atomic bombs could come only from a transnational
                                organization such as the newly formed United Nations, which could
                                institute a program to stifle a nuclear arms race.[165]

                                        In November 1945, Oppenheimer left Los Alamos to return to
                                        Caltech,[166] but soon found that his heart was no longer in
                                        teaching.[167] In 1947, he accepted an offer from Lewis
                                        Strauss to take up the directorship of the Institute for
                                        Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. This meant moving
                                        back east and leaving Ruth Tolman, the wife of his friend
                                        Richard Tolman, with whom he had begun an affair after
                                        leaving Los Alamos.[168] The job came with a salary of
                                        $20,000 per annum, plus rent-free accommodation in the
                                        director's house, a 17th-century manor with a cook and
                                        groundskeeper, surrounded by 265 acres (107 ha) of
                                        woodlands.[169] He collected European furniture, and French
                                        post-impressionist and Fauvist artworks. His art collection
                                        included works by Cézanne, Derain, Despiau, de Vlaminck,
                                        Picasso, Rembrandt, Renoir, Van Gogh and Vuillard.[170]
                                        Oppenheimer brought together intellectuals at the height of
                                        their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the
                                        most pertinent questions of the age. He directed and
                                        encouraged the research of many well-known scientists,
                                        including Freeman Dyson, and the duo of Chen Ning Yang and
                                        Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of
                                        parity non-conservation. He also instituted temporary
                                        memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as T. S.
                                        Eliot and George F. Kennan. Some of these activities were
                                        resented by a few members of the mathematics faculty, who
                                        wanted the institute to stay a bastion of pure scientific
                                        research. Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought
                                        that one of his failures at the institute was being unable
                                        to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the
                                        humanities.[171] During a series of conferences in New York
                                        from 1947 through 1949, physicists transitioned from war
                                        work back to theoretical issues. Under Oppenheimer's
                                        direction, physicists tackled the greatest outstanding
                                        problem of the pre-war years: infinite, divergent, and
                                        seemingly nonsensical expressions in the quantum
                                        electrodynamics of elementary particles. Julian Schwinger,
                                        Richard Feynman and Shin'ichiro Tomonaga tackled the problem
                                        of regularization, and developed techniques that became
                                        known as renormalization. Freeman Dyson was able to prove
                                        that their procedures gave similar results. The problem of
                                        meson absorption and Hideki Yukawa's theory of mesons as the
                                        carrier particles of the strong nuclear force were also
                                        tackled. Probing questions from Oppenheimer prompted Robert
                                        Marshak's innovative two-meson hypothesis: that there are
                                        actually two types of mesons, pions and muons. This led to
                                        Cecil Frank Powell's breakthrough and subsequent Nobel Prize
                                        for the discovery of the pion.[172][note 6] Oppenheimer
                                        served as director of the institute until 1966, when he gave
                                        up the position due to his failing health.[174] As of 2023,
                                        he is the longest-serving director of the institute.[175]

                                        As a member of the Board of Consultants to a committee
                                        appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the
                                        1946 Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In this report, the
                                        committee advocated the creation of an international Atomic
                                        Development Authority, which would own all fissionable
                                        material and the means of its production, such as mines and
                                        laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used
                                        for peaceful energy production. Bernard Baruch was appointed
                                        to translate this report into a proposal to the United
                                        Nations, resulting in the Baruch Plan of 1946. The Baruch
                                        Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding
                                        enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the
                                        Soviet Union's uranium resources. It was seen as an attempt
                                        to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and rejected
                                        by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer
                                        that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual
                                        suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union,[176]
                                        which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.[177] After
                                        the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) came into being in 1947
                                        as a civilian agency in control of nuclear research and
                                        weapons issues, Oppenheimer was appointed as the chairman of
                                        its General Advisory Committee (GAC). From this position, he
                                        advised on a number of nuclear-related issues, including
                                        project funding, laboratory construction and even
                                        international policy—though the GAC's advice was not always
                                        heeded.[178] As chairman of the GAC, Oppenheimer lobbied
                                        vigorously for international arms control and funding for
                                        basic science, and attempted to influence policy away from a
                                        heated arms race.[179] The first atomic bomb test by the
                                        Soviet Union in August 1949 came earlier than Americans
                                        expected, and over the next several months, there was an
                                        intense debate within the U.S. government, military, and
                                        scientific communities over whether to proceed with the
                                        development of the far more powerful, nuclear fusion-based
                                        hydrogen bomb, then known as "the Super".[180] Oppenheimer
                                        had been aware of the possibility of a thermonuclear weapon
                                        since the days of the Manhattan Project and had allocated a
                                        limited amount of theoretical research work toward the
                                        possibility at the time, but nothing more than that, given
                                        the pressing need to develop a fission weapon.[181]
                                        Immediately following the end of the war, Oppenheimer argued
                                        against continuing work on the Super at that time, due to
                                        both lack of need and the enormous human casualties that
                                        would result from its use.[182][183] Now in October 1949,
                                        Oppenheimer and the GAC recommended against the development
                                        of the Super.[184] He and the other GAC members were
                                        motivated partly by ethical concerns, feeling that such a
                                        weapon could only be strategically used, resulting in
                                        millions of deaths: "Its use therefore carries much further
                                        than the atomic bomb itself the policy of exterminating
                                        civilian populations".[185] They also had practical qualms,
                                        as there was no workable design for a hydrogen bomb at the
                                        time.[186] Regarding the possibility of the Soviet Union
                                        developing a thermonuclear weapon, the GAC felt that the
                                        United States could have an adequate stockpile of atomic
                                        weapons to retaliate against any thermonuclear attack.[187]
                                        In that connection, Oppenheimer and the others were
                                        concerned about the opportunity costs that would be incurred
                                        if nuclear reactors were diverted from materials needed for
                                        atom bomb production to the materials such as tritium needed
                                        for a thermonuclear weapon.[188][189] A majority of the AEC
                                        subsequently endorsed the GAC recommendation, and
                                        Oppenheimer thought that the fight against the Super would
                                        triumph, but proponents of the weapon lobbied the White
                                        House vigorously.[190] On January 31, 1950, Truman, who was
                                        predisposed to proceed with the development of the weapon
                                        anyway, made the formal decision to do so.[191] Oppenheimer
                                        and other GAC opponents of the project, especially James
                                        Conant, felt disheartened and considered resigning from the
                                        committee.[192] They stayed on, though their views on the
                                        hydrogen bomb were well known.[193] In 1951, Edward Teller
                                        and mathematician Stanislaw Ulam developed the Teller-Ulam
                                        design for a hydrogen bomb.[194] This new design seemed
                                        technically feasible and Oppenheimer officially acceded to
                                        the weapon's development,[195] while still looking for ways
                                        in which its testing or deployment or use could be
                                        questioned.[196] As he later recalled:

                                        The program we had in 1949 was a tortured thing that you
                                        could well argue did not make a great deal of technical
                                        sense. It was therefore possible to argue also that you did
                                        not want it even if you could have it. The program in 1951
                                        was technically so sweet that you could not argue about
                                        that. The issues became purely the military, the political
                                        and the humane problem of what you were going to do about it
                                        once you had it.[197]

                                        Oppenheimer, Conant, and Lee DuBridge, another member who
                                        had opposed the H-bomb decision, left the GAC when their
                                        terms expired in August 1952.[198] Truman had declined to
                                        reappoint them, as he wanted new voices on the committee who
                                        were more in support of H-bomb development.[199] In
                                        addition, various opponents of Oppenheimer had communicated
                                        to Truman their desire that Oppenheimer leave the
                                        committee.[200]

                                        Oppenheimer played a role on a number of government panels
                                        and study projects during the late 1940s and early 1950s,
                                        some of which thrust him into controversies and power
                                        struggles.[201] In 1948, Oppenheimer chaired the Department
                                        of Defense's Long-Range Objectives Panel, which looked at
                                        the military utility of nuclear weapons including how they
                                        might be delivered.[202] After a year's worth of study, in
                                        spring 1952, Oppenheimer wrote the draft report of Project
                                        GABRIEL, which examined the dangers of nuclear fallout.[203]
                                        Oppenheimer was also a member of the Science Advisory
                                        Committee of the Office of Defense Mobilization.[204]
                                        Oppenheimer participated in Project Charles during 1951,
                                        which examined the possibility of creating an effective air
                                        defense of the United States against atomic attack, and in
                                        the follow-on Project East River in 1952, which, with
                                        Oppenheimer's input, recommended building a warning system
                                        that would provide one-hour notice of an impending atomic
                                        attack against American cities.[203] Those two projects led
                                        to Project Lincoln in 1952, a large effort on which
                                        Oppenheimer was one of the senior scientists.[203]
                                        Undertaken at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which had recently
                                        been founded to study issues of air defense, this in turn
                                        led to the Lincoln Summer Study Group, in which Oppenheimer
                                        became a key figure.[205] Oppenheimer's and other
                                        scientists' urging that resources be allocated to air
                                        defense in preference to large retaliatory strike
                                        capabilities brought an immediate response of objection from
                                        the United States Air Force (USAF),[206] and debate ensued
                                        about whether Oppenheimer and allied scientists, or the Air
                                        Force, was embracing an inflexible "Maginot Line"
                                        philosophy.[207] In any case, the Summer Study Group's work
                                        eventually led to the building of the Distant Early Warning
                                        Line.[208] Teller, who had been so uninterested in work on
                                        the atomic bomb at Los Alamos during the war that
                                        Oppenheimer had given him time instead to work on his own
                                        project of the hydrogen bomb,[209] left Los Alamos in 1951
                                        to help found, in 1952, a second laboratory at what would
                                        become the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.[210]
                                        Oppenheimer had defended the history of work done at Los
                                        Alamos and opposed the creation of the second
                                        laboratory.[211] Project Vista looked at improving U.S.
                                        tactical warfare capabilities.[203] Oppenheimer was a late
                                        addition to the project in 1951 but wrote a key chapter of
                                        the report that challenged the doctrine of strategic
                                        bombardment and advocated smaller tactical nuclear weapons
                                        which would be more useful in a limited theater conflict
                                        against enemy forces.[212] Strategic thermonuclear weapons
                                        delivered by long-range jet bombers would necessarily be
                                        under the control of the U.S. Air Force, whereas the Vista
                                        conclusions recommended an increased role for the U.S. Army
                                        and U.S. Navy as well.[213] The Air Force reaction to this
                                        was immediately hostile,[214] and it succeeded in getting
                                        the Vista report suppressed.[215] During 1952, Oppenheimer
                                        chaired the five-member State Department Panel of
                                        Consultants on Disarmament,[216] which first urged that the
                                        United States postpone its planned first test of the
                                        hydrogen bomb and seek a thermonuclear test ban with the
                                        Soviet Union, on the grounds that avoiding a test might
                                        forestall the development of a catastrophic new weapon and
                                        open the way for new arms agreements between the two
                                        nations.[217] But the panel lacked political allies in
                                        Washington, and the Ivy Mike shot went ahead as
                                        scheduled.[216] The panel then issued a final report in
                                        January 1953, which, influenced by many of Oppenheimer's
                                        deeply felt beliefs, presented a pessimistic vision of the
                                        future in which neither the United States nor the Soviet
                                        Union could establish effective nuclear superiority but both
                                        sides could inflict terrible damage on the other.[218] One
                                        of the panel's recommendations, which Oppenheimer felt was
                                        especially important,[219] was that the U.S. government
                                        practice less secrecy and more openness toward the American
                                        people about the realities of the nuclear balance and the
                                        dangers of nuclear warfare.[218] This notion found a
                                        receptive audience in the new Eisenhower administration and
                                        led to the creation of Operation Candor.[220] Oppenheimer
                                        subsequently presented his view on the lack of utility of
                                        ever-larger nuclear arsenals to the American public in a
                                        June 1953 article in Foreign Affairs,[221][222] and it
                                        received attention in major American newspapers.[223] Thus
                                        by 1953, Oppenheimer had reached another peak of influence,
                                        being involved in multiple different government posts and
                                        projects and having access to crucial strategic plans and
                                        force levels.[109] But at the same time, he had become the
                                        enemy of the proponents of strategic bombardment, who viewed
                                        his opposition to the H-bomb, followed by these accumulated
                                        positions and stances, with a combination of bitterness and
                                        distrust.[224] This view was paired with their fear that
                                        Oppenheimer's fame and powers of persuasion had made him
                                        dangerously influential in government, military, and
                                        scientific circles.[225]

                                        The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover had been following Oppenheimer
                                        since before the war, when he showed Communist sympathies as
                                        a professor at Berkeley and had been close to members of the
                                        Communist Party, including his wife and brother. They
                                        strongly suspected that he himself was a member of the
                                        party, based on wiretaps in which party members referred to
                                        him or appeared to refer to him as a communist, as well as
                                        reports from informers within the party.[226] He had been
                                        under close surveillance since the early 1940s, his home and
                                        office bugged, his phone tapped and his mail opened.[227] In
                                        August 1943, Oppenheimer told Manhattan Project security
                                        agents that George Eltenton, whom he did not know, had
                                        solicited three men at Los Alamos for nuclear secrets on
                                        behalf of the Soviet Union. When pressed on the issue in
                                        later interviews, Oppenheimer admitted that the only person
                                        who had approached him was his friend Haakon Chevalier, a
                                        Berkeley professor of French literature, who had mentioned
                                        the matter privately at a dinner at Oppenheimer's
                                        house.[228] The FBI furnished Oppenheimer's political
                                        enemies with evidence that intimated communist ties. These
                                        enemies included Strauss, an AEC commissioner who had long
                                        harbored resentment against Oppenheimer both for his
                                        activity in opposing the hydrogen bomb and for his
                                        humiliation of Strauss before Congress some years earlier.
                                        Strauss had expressed opposition to exporting radioactive
                                        isotopes to other nations, and Oppenheimer had called them
                                        "less important than electronic devices but more important
                                        than, let us say, vitamins".[229] On June 7, 1949,
                                        Oppenheimer testified before the House Un-American
                                        Activities Committee that he had associations with the
                                        Communist Party USA in the 1930s.[230] He testified that
                                        some of his students, including David Bohm, Giovanni Rossi
                                        Lomanitz, Philip Morrison, Bernard Peters, and Joseph
                                        Weinberg had been communists at the time they had worked
                                        with him at Berkeley. Frank Oppenheimer and his wife Jackie
                                        testified before HUAC that they had been members of the
                                        Communist Party USA. Frank was subsequently fired from his
                                        University of Minnesota position. Unable to find work in
                                        physics for many years, he became a cattle rancher in
                                        Colorado. He later taught high school physics and was the
                                        founder of the San Francisco Exploratorium.[79][231] The
                                        triggering event for the security hearing happened on
                                        November 7, 1953,[232] when William Liscum Borden, who until
                                        earlier in the year had been the executive director of the
                                        United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy,
                                        sent Hoover a letter saying that "more probably than not J.
                                        Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union".[233]
                                        Eisenhower never exactly believed the allegations in the
                                        letter but felt compelled to move forward with an
                                        investigation,[234] and on December 3, he ordered that a
                                        "blank wall" be placed between Oppenheimer and any
                                        government or military secrets.[235] On December 21, 1953,
                                        Strauss told Oppenheimer that his security clearance had
                                        been suspended, pending resolution of a series of charges
                                        outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning by way of
                                        requesting termination of his consulting contract with the
                                        AEC.[236] Oppenheimer chose not to resign and requested a
                                        hearing instead.[237] The charges were outlined in a letter
                                        from Kenneth D. Nichols, general manager of the
                                        AEC.[238][239] Nichols wrote that he was "not happy with the
                                        inclusion of a reference concerning Oppenheimer's opposition
                                        to the hydrogen bomb development".[240] He considered that
                                        "in spite of his record he is loyal to the United
                                        States".[241] The hearing that followed in April–May 1954,
                                        which was held in secret, focused on Oppenheimer's past
                                        communist ties and his association during the Manhattan
                                        Project with suspected disloyal or communist
                                        scientists.[242] It then continued with an examination of
                                        Oppenheimer's opposition to the H-bomb and stances in
                                        subsequent projects and study groups.[243] A transcript of
                                        the hearings was published in June 1954,[244] with some
                                        redactions. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Energy made the
                                        full transcript public.[245][246] Teller testified that he
                                        considered Oppenheimer loyal to the U.S. government, but
                                        that:

                                        In a great number of cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer
                                        act—I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted—in a way which
                                        for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly
                                        disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions
                                        frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this
                                        extent I feel that I would like to see the vital interests
                                        of this country in hands which I understand better, and
                                        therefore trust more. In this very limited sense I would
                                        like to express a feeling that I would feel personally more
                                        secure if public matters would rest in other hands.[249]

                                        Teller's testimony outraged the scientific community, and he
                                        was virtually ostracized from academic science.[250] Ernest
                                        Lawrence refused to testify, pleading an attack of
                                        ulcerative colitis, but an interview in which Lawrence
                                        condemned Oppenheimer was submitted in evidence.[251] Many
                                        top scientists, as well as government and military figures,
                                        testified on Oppenheimer's behalf. Physicist Isidor Isaac
                                        Rabi said that the suspension of the security clearance was
                                        unnecessary: "he is a consultant, and if you don't want to
                                        consult the guy, you don't consult him, period."[252] But
                                        Groves testified that, under the stricter security criteria
                                        in effect in 1954, he "would not clear Dr. Oppenheimer
                                        today".[253] At the conclusion of the hearings, the board
                                        revoked Oppenheimer's clearance by a 2–1 vote.[254] It
                                        unanimously cleared him of disloyalty, but a majority found
                                        that 20 of the 24 charges were either true or substantially
                                        true and that Oppenheimer would represent a security
                                        risk.[255] Then on June 29, 1954, the AEC upheld the
                                        findings of the Personnel Security Board, by a 4–1 decision,
                                        with Strauss writing the majority opinion.[256] In that
                                        opinion, he stressed Oppenheimer's "defects of character",
                                        "falsehoods, evasions and misrepresentations", and past
                                        associations with Communists and people close to Communists
                                        as the primary reasons for his determination. He did not
                                        comment on Oppenheimer's loyalty.[257] During his hearing,
                                        Oppenheimer testified willingly on the left-wing activities
                                        of many of his colleagues. Had his clearance not been
                                        stripped, he might have been remembered as someone who
                                        "named names" to save his own reputation,[258] but as it
                                        happened, most in the scientific community saw him as a
                                        martyr to McCarthyism, an eclectic liberal unjustly attacked
                                        by warmongering enemies, symbolic of the shift of scientific
                                        work from academia into the military.[259] Wernher von Braun
                                        told a Congressional committee: "In England, Oppenheimer
                                        would have been knighted".[260] In a seminar at The Wilson
                                        Center in 2009, based on an extensive analysis of the
                                        Vassiliev notebooks taken from the KGB archives, John Earl
                                        Haynes, Harvey Klehr and Alexander Vassiliev confirmed that
                                        Oppenheimer never was involved in espionage for the Soviet
                                        Union, though Soviet intelligence tried repeatedly to
                                        recruit him. Further, he had several persons removed from
                                        the Manhattan Project who had sympathies to the Soviet
                                        Union.[261] Haynes, Klehr and Vassiliev also state
                                        Oppenheimer "was, in fact, a concealed member of the CPUSA
                                        in the late 1930s".[262] According to biographer Ray Monk:
                                        "He was, in a very practical and real sense, a supporter of
                                        the Communist Party. Moreover, in terms of the time, effort
                                        and money spent on party activities, he was a very committed
                                        supporter."[263] On December 16, 2022, United States
                                        Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm vacated the 1954
                                        revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance.[264] Her
                                        statement said, "In 1954, the Atomic Energy Commission
                                        revoked Dr. Oppenheimer's security clearance through a
                                        flawed process that violated the Commission's own
                                        regulations. As time has passed, more evidence has come to
                                        light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr.
                                        Oppenheimer was subjected to while the evidence of his
                                        loyalty and love of country have only been further
                                        affirmed."[265][264][266]

                                Starting in 1954, Oppenheimer lived for several months of each year
                                on the island of Saint John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. In 1957, he
                                purchased a 2-acre (0.81 ha) tract of land on Gibney Beach, where he
                                built a spartan home on the beach.[268] He spent considerable time
                                sailing with his daughter Toni and wife Kitty.[269] Oppenheimer's
                                first public appearance following the stripping of his security
                                clearance was a lecture titled "Prospects in the Arts and Sciences"
                                for the Columbia University Bicentennial radio show Man's Right to
                                Knowledge, in which he outlined his philosophy and his thoughts on
                                the role of science in the modern world.[270][271] He had been
                                selected for the final episode of the lecture series two years prior
                                to the security hearing, though the university remained adamant that
                                he stay on even after the controversy.[272] In February 1955, the
                                president of the University of Washington, Henry Schmitz, abruptly
                                canceled an invitation to Oppenheimer to deliver a series of
                                lectures there. Schmitz's decision caused an uproar among the
                                students; 1,200 of them signed a petition protesting the decision,
                                and Schmitz was burned in effigy. While they marched in protest, the
                                state of Washington outlawed the Communist Party, and required all
                                government employees to swear a loyalty oath. Edwin Albrecht
                                Uehling, the chairman of the physics department and a colleague of
                                Oppenheimer's from Berkeley, appealed to the university senate, and
                                Schmitz's decision was overturned by a vote of 56 to 40. Oppenheimer
                                stopped briefly in Seattle to change planes on a trip to Oregon and
                                was joined for coffee during his layover by several University of
                                Washington faculty, but Oppenheimer never lectured there.[273][274]
                                Oppenheimer was increasingly concerned about the danger that
                                scientific inventions could pose to humanity. He joined with Albert
                                Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Joseph Rotblat, and other eminent
                                scientists and academics to establish what would eventually, in
                                1960, become the World Academy of Art and Science. Significantly,
                                after his public humiliation, he did not sign the major open
                                protests against nuclear weapons of the 1950s, including the
                                Russell–Einstein Manifesto of 1955, nor, though invited, did he
                                attend the first Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs in
                                1957.[275] In his speeches and public writings, Oppenheimer
                                continually stressed the difficulty of managing the power of
                                knowledge in a world in which the freedom of science to exchange
                                ideas was more and more hobbled by political concerns. Oppenheimer
                                delivered the Reith Lectures on the BBC in 1953, which were
                                subsequently published as Science and the Common Understanding.[276]
                                In 1955, Oppenheimer published The Open Mind, a collection of eight
                                lectures that he had given since 1946 on the subject of nuclear
                                weapons and popular culture.[277] Oppenheimer rejected the idea of
                                nuclear gunboat diplomacy. "The purposes of this country in the
                                field of foreign policy", he wrote, "cannot in any real or enduring
                                way be achieved by coercion".[278] In 1957, the philosophy and
                                psychology departments at Harvard invited Oppenheimer to deliver the
                                William James Lectures. An influential group of Harvard alumni led
                                by Edwin Ginn that included Archibald Roosevelt protested the
                                decision.[279] 1,200 people attended Oppenheimer's six lectures,
                                "The Hope of Order", in Sanders Theatre.[275] In 1962, Oppenheimer
                                delivered the Whidden Lectures at McMaster University, which were
                                published in 1964 as The Flying Trapeze: Three Crises for
                                Physicists.[280] In September 1957, France made him an Officer of
                                the Legion of Honor,[284] and on May 3, 1962, he was elected a
                                Foreign Member of the Royal Society in Britain.[285][286]

                                        <h3>Enrico Fermi Award</h3>

                                        In 1959, then-Senator John F. Kennedy voted to deny Lewis
                                        Strauss, Oppenheimer's greatest detractor in his security
                                        hearings, confirmation as Secretary of Commerce, effectively
                                        ending Strauss's political career. In 1962, Kennedy―now
                                        President of the United States―invited Oppenheimer to a
                                        ceremony honoring 49 Nobel Prize winners. At the event, AEC
                                        chairman Glenn Seaborg asked Oppenheimer whether he wanted
                                        another security hearing. Oppenheimer declined.[287] In
                                        March 1963, the General Advisory committee of the AEC
                                        selected Oppenheimer to receive its Enrico Fermi Award, an
                                        award Congress had created in 1954.[287] Kennedy was
                                        assassinated before he could present the award to
                                        Oppenheimer, but his successor, Lyndon Johnson, did so in a
                                        December 1963 ceremony at which he cited Oppenheimer's
                                        "contributions to theoretical physics as a teacher and
                                        originator of ideas, [and] leadership of the Los Alamos
                                        Laboratory and the atomic energy program during critical
                                        years".[288] He called the signing of the award one of
                                        Kennedy's greatest acts as president.[289] Oppenheimer told
                                        Johnson, "I think it is just possible, Mr. President, that
                                        it has taken some charity and some courage for you to make
                                        this award today".[289][290] Kennedy's widow, Jackie, made a
                                        point of attending the ceremony so she could tell
                                        Oppenheimer how much her husband had wanted him to have the
                                        medal.[288] Also present were Edward Teller, who had
                                        recommended Oppenheimer receive the award in hopes that it
                                        would heal the rift between them,[291] and Henry D. Smyth,
                                        who in 1954 had been the lone dissenter from the AEC's 4–1
                                        decision to define Oppenheimer as a security risk. But
                                        congressional hostility to Oppenheimer lingered. Senator
                                        Bourke B. Hickenlooper formally protested Oppenheimer's
                                        selection just eight days after Kennedy was killed,[287] and
                                        several Republican members of the House AEC Committee
                                        boycotted the ceremony.[292] The rehabilitation represented
                                        by the award was symbolic, as Oppenheimer still lacked a
                                        security clearance and could have no effect on official
                                        policy, but the award came with a $50,000 tax-free
                                        stipend.[289]

                                A chain smoker, Oppenheimer was diagnosed with throat cancer in late
                                1965. After inconclusive surgery, he underwent unsuccessful
                                radiation treatment and chemotherapy late in 1966. On February 18,
                                1967, he died in his sleep at his home in Princeton, aged 62
                                years.[174] A memorial service was held a week later at Alexander
                                Hall on the campus of Princeton University.[293] The service was
                                attended by 600 of his scientific, political, and military
                                associates, including Bethe, Groves, Kennan, Lilienthal, Rabi,
                                Smyth, and Wigner. His brother Frank and the rest of his family were
                                there, as was the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the novelist
                                John O'Hara, and George Balanchine, the director of the New York
                                City Ballet. Bethe, Kennan and Smyth gave brief eulogies.[294]
                                Oppenheimer's body was cremated and his ashes placed in an urn,
                                which Kitty dropped into the sea within sight of the St. John beach
                                house.[295] In October 1972, Kitty died aged 62 from an intestinal
                                infection complicated by a pulmonary embolism.[296] Oppenheimer's
                                ranch in New Mexico was then inherited by their son Peter, and the
                                beach property was inherited by their daughter Katherine "Toni"
                                Oppenheimer Silber. Toni was refused security clearance for her
                                chosen vocation as a United Nations translator after the FBI brought
                                up the old charges against her father. In January 1977, three months
                                after her second marriage ended, she hanged herself in her family
                                beach house.[297] She left the property to "the people of St. John
                                for a public park and recreation area".[298] The original house was
                                built too close to the coast and succumbed to a hurricane. As of
                                2007, the Virgin Islands Government maintained a Community Center
                                nearby.[299]

                                When Oppenheimer was stripped of his political influence in 1954, he
                                symbolized for many the folly of scientists who believed they could
                                control the use of their research, and the dilemmas of moral
                                responsibility presented by science in the nuclear age.[300] The
                                hearings were motivated by politics and personal enmities, and
                                reflected a stark divide in the nuclear weapons community.[301] One
                                group passionately feared the Soviet Union as a mortal enemy, and
                                believed having the most powerful weaponry capable of providing the
                                most massive retaliation was the best strategy to combat that
                                threat. The other group thought developing the H-bomb would not
                                improve Western security and that using the weapon against large
                                civilian populations would be genocide; they advocated instead a
                                more flexible response to the Soviets involving tactical nuclear
                                weapons, strengthened conventional forces, and arms control
                                agreements. The first of these groups was the more powerful in
                                political terms, and Oppenheimer became its target.[302][303] Rather
                                than consistently oppose the "Red-baiting" of the late 1940s and
                                early 1950s, Oppenheimer testified against former colleagues and
                                students, before and during his hearing. In one incident, his
                                damning testimony against former student Bernard Peters was
                                selectively leaked to the press. Historians have interpreted this as
                                an attempt by Oppenheimer to please his colleagues in the government
                                and perhaps to divert attention from his own previous left-wing ties
                                and those of his brother. In the end, it became a liability when it
                                became clear Oppenheimer had really doubted Peters's loyalty, and
                                recommending him for the Manhattan Project was reckless, or at least
                                contradictory.[304] Popular depictions of Oppenheimer view his
                                security struggles as a confrontation between right-wing militarists
                                (represented by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (represented by
                                Oppenheimer) over the moral question of weapons of mass
                                destruction.[305] Biographers and historians have often viewed
                                Oppenheimer's story as a tragedy.[306][307][308] National security
                                advisor and academic McGeorge Bundy, who worked with Oppenheimer on
                                the State Department Panel of Consultants, wrote: "Quite aside from
                                Oppenheimer's extraordinary rise and fall in prestige and power, his
                                character has fully tragic dimensions in its combination of charm
                                and arrogance, intelligence and blindness, awareness and
                                insensitivity, and perhaps above all daring and fatalism. All these,
                                in different ways, were turned against him in the hearings."[308]
                                The question of scientists' responsibility toward humanity inspired
                                Bertolt Brecht's drama Life of Galileo (1955), left its imprint on
                                Friedrich Dürrenmatt's The Physicists, and is the basis of John
                                Adams's 2005 opera Doctor Atomic, which was commissioned to portray
                                Oppenheimer as a modern-day Faust. Heinar Kipphardt's play In the
                                Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer, after appearing on West German
                                television, had its theatrical release in Berlin and Munich in
                                October 1964. Oppenheimer's objections resulted in an exchange of
                                correspondence with Kipphardt, in which Kipphardt offered to make
                                corrections but defended the play.[309] It premiered in New York in
                                1968, with Joseph Wiseman as Oppenheimer. New York Times theater
                                critic Clive Barnes called it an "angry play and a partisan play"
                                that sided with Oppenheimer but portrayed him as a "tragic fool and
                                genius".[310] Oppenheimer had difficulty with this portrayal. After
                                reading a transcript of Kipphardt's play soon after it began to be
                                performed, Oppenheimer threatened to sue Kipphardt, decrying
                                "improvisations which were contrary to history and to the nature of
                                the people involved".[311] Later Oppenheimer told an interviewer:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                The whole damn thing [his security hearing] was a farce, and these
                                people are trying to make a tragedy out of it. ... I had never said
                                that I had regretted participating in a responsible way in the
                                making of the bomb. I said that perhaps he [Kipphardt] had forgotten
                                Guernica, Coventry, Hamburg, Dresden, Dachau, Warsaw, and Tokyo; but
                                I had not, and that if he found it so difficult to understand, he
                                should write a play about something else.[312]

                                Oppenheimer is the subject of many biographies, including American
                                Prometheus (2005) by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, which won the
                                2006 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography.[313] The 1980
                                BBC TV serial Oppenheimer, starring Sam Waterston, won 3 BAFTA
                                Television Awards.[314] The Day After Trinity, a 1980 documentary
                                about Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb, was nominated for an Academy
                                Award and received a Peabody Award.[315][316] Oppenheimer's life is
                                explored in Tom Morton-Smith's 2015 play Oppenheimer,[317] and the
                                1989 film Fat Man and Little Boy, where he was portrayed by Dwight
                                Schultz.[318] In the same year, David Strathairn played Oppenheimer
                                in the TV movie Day One.[319] In the 2023 American film Oppenheimer,
                                directed by Christopher Nolan and based on American Prometheus,
                                Oppenheimer is portrayed by actor Cillian Murphy.[320] A centennial
                                conference about Oppenheimer's legacy was held in 2004 at the
                                University of California, Berkeley, alongside a digital exhibition
                                on his life,[321] with the conference proceedings published in 2005
                                as Reappraising Oppenheimer: Centennial Studies and
                                Reflections.[322] His papers are in the Library of Congress.[323] As
                                a scientist, Oppenheimer was remembered by his students and
                                colleagues as a brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who
                                founded modern theoretical physics in the United States. "More than
                                any other man", Bethe wrote, "he was responsible for raising
                                American theoretical physics from a provincial adjunct of Europe to
                                world leadership".[324] Because his scientific attentions often
                                changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and
                                carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize,[325] though his
                                investigations contributing to the theory of black holes might have
                                warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought to
                                fruition by later astrophysicists.[106] An asteroid, 67085
                                Oppenheimer, was named in his honor on January 4, 2000,[326] as was
                                the lunar crater Oppenheimer in 1970.[327] As a military and public
                                policy advisor, Oppenheimer was a leader in the shift toward
                                technocracy in the interactions between science and the military,
                                and in the emergence of "big science". During World War II,
                                scientists became involved in military research to an unprecedented
                                degree. Because of the threat fascism posed to Western civilization,
                                they volunteered in great numbers for technological, and
                                organizational, assistance to the Allied effort, resulting in
                                powerful tools such as radar, the proximity fuze and operations
                                research. As a cultured, intellectual, theoretical physicist who
                                became a disciplined military organizer, Oppenheimer represented the
                                shift away from the idea that scientists had their "heads in the
                                clouds" and that knowledge of esoteric subjects like the composition
                                of the atomic nucleus had no "real-world" applications.[300] Two
                                days before the Trinity test, Oppenheimer expressed his hopes and
                                fears in a quotation from Bhartṛhari's Śatakatraya:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                In battle, in the forest, at the precipice in the mountains,
                                <br />
                                On the dark great sea, in the midst of javelins and arrows,
                                <br />
                                In sleep, in confusion, in the depths of shame,
                                <br />
                                The good deeds a man has done before defend him.[328][329]
