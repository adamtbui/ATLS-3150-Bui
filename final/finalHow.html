                            Incorporating universal design into websites involves a thoughtful and
                            intentional approach to ensure accessibility and inclusivity for users
                            of all abilities. Firstly, consider the structure and layout of the
                            website, emphasizing clear and consistent navigation. Implementing
                            descriptive and meaningful headings aids both sighted and screen reader
                            users in understanding content hierarchies. Provide alternative text for
                            images, allowing those with visual impairments to comprehend the visual
                            elements. Ensure text has sufficient contrast for readability, and use
                            scalable fonts to accommodate various viewing preferences. Offer
                            keyboard navigation options to assist users with mobility impairments.
                            Caption multimedia content for those with hearing impairments, and
                            provide transcripts for audio elements. Regularly test your website
                            using accessibility tools and engage with user testing involving
                            individuals with diverse abilities. Additionally, staying informed about
                            evolving accessibility standards, such as WCAG, and incorporating them
                            into your design and development processes is crucial for creating a
                            universally accessible website. Overall, the key is to integrate
                            accessibility considerations from the outset and maintain an ongoing
                            commitment to inclusivity throughout the website's lifecycle.

                            Mobile design is one of the more popular ways of having Universal Design
                            within a website. Mobile First design is a web development strategy that
                            emphasizes creating a website with a primary focus on mobile devices
                            before expanding to larger screens. It recognizes the prevalence of
                            mobile internet usage and aims to deliver an optimal user experience on
                            smaller screens. This approach involves prioritizing essential content
                            and features for mobile users, employing responsive design techniques to
                            adapt layouts across various screen sizes, and optimizing for mobile
                            performance to enhance speed and efficiency. User interfaces are
                            designed with touch interactions in mind, featuring elements like larger
                            buttons for ease of use. As the screen size increases, the design is
                            progressively enhanced to take advantage of larger displays while
                            maintaining a consistent and streamlined user experience. Overall,
                            Mobile First design not only caters to the growing mobile audience but
                            also streamlines the design process by starting with the constraints and
                            priorities of smaller screens.
