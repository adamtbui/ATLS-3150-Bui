                        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                        <p>
                            Accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing
                            websites in a way that ensures equal access and usability for all
                            individuals, including those with disabilities. The goal of web
                            accessibility is to eliminate barriers that may prevent people with
                            disabilities from interacting with or accessing information on websites.
                            This includes considerations for individuals with visual, auditory,
                            cognitive, or motor impairments. Common accessibility practices include
                            providing alternative text for images, ensuring proper heading
                            structures, using descriptive link text, creating keyboard-friendly
                            navigation, providing captions for multimedia content, and designing
                            with a focus on readability and simplicity. Compliance with
                            international standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility
                            Guidelines (WCAG), is often a key aspect of web accessibility efforts.
                            By making websites more accessible, developers contribute to a more
                            inclusive online experience, ensuring that all users, regardless of
                            their abilities, can navigate, perceive, and interact with digital
                            content effectively.

                        <p>
                            Universal design, also known as accessible design or inclusive design,
                            is a holistic approach aimed at creating products, environments, and
                            systems that are inherently accessible to and usable by people of all
                            abilities, ages, and backgrounds. The fundamental principle behind
                            universal design is to promote inclusivity by minimizing barriers and
                            maximizing usability for everyone, regardless of physical or cognitive
                            differences. This design philosophy extends beyond mere compliance with
                            accessibility standards, emphasizing the anticipation of diverse user
                            needs from the outset of the design process. Universal design strives to
                            create environments and products that are welcoming, flexible, and
                            user-friendly, fostering independence and equal participation for
                            individuals with disabilities while benefiting a broader spectrum of
                            users. Whether in architecture, technology, or everyday products, the
                            goal of universal design is to ensure that the built environment and
                            innovations are inherently accessible and enhance the quality of life
                            for everyone.

                    features in their design.
